## About the repo

This demo application was made for completion of Liquid Galaxy Pre-Selection Req-2
So the application does basically nothing (as of now hehe), consists of the logo and 4 eye catchy buttons 😉.

Making this app was definitely a good learning experience considering me being new to the flutter framework ✏️
(Setup took some time on arch tho so linking below some valuable resources for setup and also some flutter resources).
